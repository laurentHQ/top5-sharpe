## Task Group Priority
**Phase**: Project Foundation
**Dependencies**: None (starting point)
**Blocks**: All development work
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

**Pull Policy**: "Move right only if WIP < limit and AC clarified"

**Classes of Service:**
- **Expedite**: Production hotfixes and security incidents (reserved placeholders)
- **FixedDate**: Live demo day releases
- **Standard**: Feature development
- **Intangible**: Documentation, CI/CD, governance
