# Strategic Project Task Planning Template

A comprehensive template for creating complete project task structures with strategic planning, multi-agent orchestration, and Task-Master-AI compatibility.

## Overview

This template generates a complete project task structure that follows Kanban methodology, multi-agent development patterns, and strategic planning principles. Use this template to create standardized project documentation with proper task numbering, dependencies, and agent workflows.

## Template Usage

Replace the following placeholders with your project specifics:
- `{PROJECT_NAME}`: Your project name
- `{GITHUB_OWNER}`: GitHub username/organization
- `{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}`: Brief project description
- `{TECH_STACK}`: Primary technology stack
- `{TARGET_TIMELINE}`: Expected completion timeline
- `{DOMAIN_TYPE}`: web-app|mobile-app|api-service|data-platform|ml-system
