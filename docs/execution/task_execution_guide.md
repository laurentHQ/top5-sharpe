# Task Execution Guide - Multi-Agent Kanban Workflow

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for executing tasks imported from `/create-kanban-tasks` command with optimal parallel workflows and agent coordination.

## Quick Start Execution

### 1. Import Tasks in Correct Order
```bash
# Import all phases with reverse order for proper Kanban stacking
/create-kanban-tasks --all-phases --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --reverse-order --add-phase-prefix --parallel-analysis

# Alternative: Import specific phase
/create-kanban-tasks --phase 01 --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --reverse-order --add-phase-prefix
```

### 2. Verify Task Order in Kanban
After import, your Kanban board should show (top to bottom):
```

### Communication Protocols

#### Daily Standups
- **Dependencies Check**: Which tasks are blocking others?
- **Parallel Opportunities**: What can be worked on simultaneously?
- **Resource Sharing**: Are there test data or mock services to share?
- **Integration Points**: When will components be ready for integration?

#### Phase Handoffs
- **Completion Criteria**: All acceptance criteria met and verified
- **Documentation**: README and API docs updated
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum thresholds achieved
- **Dependencies**: All blocked tasks unblocked for next phase

## Parallel Execution Best Practices

### Within-Phase Parallelism
1. **Independent Tasks First**: Start tasks with no dependencies
2. **Shared Resources**: Coordinate access to test data and environments
3. **API Contracts**: Establish endpoint contracts early for frontend development
4. **Mock Services**: Use mocking to enable parallel development

### Cross-Phase Parallelism
1. **Early Scaffolding**: Frontend scaffold can start with backend scaffold
2. **Progressive Integration**: Integrate components as soon as basic functionality is available
3. **Continuous Testing**: Begin testing as soon as components are available
4. **Documentation**: Update docs continuously throughout development

### Resource Management
1. **Agent Specialization**: Assign agents to their optimal domains
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across available agents
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Have clear escalation paths for technical decisions
4. **Context Sharing**: Maintain shared understanding of project state

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Dependency Conflicts
**Problem**: Tasks blocked waiting for dependencies
**Solution**: 
- Review dependency graph and identify minimum viable deliverables
- Create mock services or data to unblock dependent tasks
- Parallel track development with integration testing

### Resource Contention
**Problem**: Multiple agents need same resources
**Solution**:
- Implement shared development environment protocols
- Use feature branches for parallel development
- Schedule resource-intensive tasks (like full API testing)

### Integration Issues
**Problem**: Components don't work together as expected
**Solution**:
- Establish clear API contracts early
- Implement contract testing between components
- Regular integration checkpoints during development

### Performance Bottlenecks
**Problem**: System doesn't meet performance requirements
**Solution**:
- Profile early and often during development
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring
- Parallel optimization tracks while continuing feature development

This execution guide ensures efficient parallel development while maintaining quality and coordination across the multi-agent team.
